# Mobile-Design-Patterns #
======================

Not sure why this page exists if somehow anyone else is looking at it. I am now using as a playground for writing stuff to demo some format stuff. Ignore it all. 

## A – Section name goes here ##
Some stuff followed by a numbered list where we define the numbers
1. Number one 
2. The second is in order
4. But despite this in code having a 4 in front, to have skipped number 3 as though it perhaps was removed, and we do not want to change the references, instead the markdown doesn't seem to like us
7\. Now we're into extended support so trying this hack of a slash after. Is this 7 or not? It should be 7.  


## B – Section name goes here ##
Some stuff
